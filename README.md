# Project 0
> _Hello, world!_

Welcome to my first project.

The objective is to create a website using the following tools and languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* GIT
* SASS

This website must attend requirements described at [https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.html](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.html).


You can access the website I've developed by clicking on this link: [https://egidiohpaixao.github.io/web-js-python-project0](https://egidiohpaixao.github.io/web-js-python-project0)

### Pages:

* index.html - Basic welcome page, using an unordered list to link to all other pages. This unordered list is found on the following pages, too. When you hover the mouse on the list item, it gets bigger (bigger font-size);
* why.html - I've used Bootstrap class "container" to show my "because"s. When you hover the mouse on each collumn, it makes the title bold. Collumns were spllited into two classes to make dark and light collumns. By using an ID, the last collumn has a unique color. If the screen size is smaller than 601px, the container gets vertically oriented.
* niceStuff.html - As I haven't used javascript (yet), I limited the webpage to some specfic components, such as alerts, buttons and list-group (flush type);
* whoAmI.html - There is my linkedin profile photo and a table with two achievements , one at high school and the other in my first year at university.
